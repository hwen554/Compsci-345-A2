###     The Report
I imagined a scenario where the user would need to see the sign-up button clearly in one interaction, and the sign-up function would be able to quickly navigate the sign-up page. Therefore, our high-fidelity prototype focuses on the following user needs:

1. Ability to click.
2. Ability to direct user to register page.
3. Ability to see different input in registration form

I designed the Home page byte is not more than 50K, because the page design should be beautiful, generous, concise as the principle, to maintain a consistent style. In order to achieve the best visual performance effect, we should pay attention to the rationality of the overall layout, so that visitors have a smooth visual experience. The primary function of a web page is to provide a form for every web user to understand the information provided by the web site. To study web design, you need to look at it from the user's point of view. Users are the key to a website's success or failure. If the user spends too much time accessing the site, there is a good chance that he or she will shut it down immediately, or that the user will leave the site as soon as the site becomes inconvenient, which is a failure of the site design and will only leave the user disappointed. So the size of the web page, including images, should not exceed 50K.

The overall style of the homepage:

1. The logo should be placed in the most prominent position of the homepage as much as possible. 2. Highlight a particular color (#A2231D) 3. Use the same effect for the same type of image 4. The main home page has two keys, one is to learn more, the other is the registration button, click the registration button can lead to the registration page. 5. The home page follows the simple design concept, introducing the place in the form of cards to show the home page theme. 6. The Footer area is designed with an up button for users to quickly return to the top. 7. Navigation bar set home, donation, registration and about several keys, greatly improving the convenience of the web page. 8. The home page sets the time display function so that the time can be displayed at the bottom.

Visual Design Choices 
A variety of design principles have been considered for the implementation of the high-fidelity prototype. Three Gestalt principles have been used in the prototype, such as the Proximity, Common Fate, and Closure principles.
